    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const teams = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    console.log(teams);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    teams[1] = "Tom";

    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(teams);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    console.log(players);

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const ateam = players.slice();


    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let newteam = [];
    newteam = newteam.concat(players);
    console.log(newteam);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let moreteam = [];
    moreteam = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    newteam[3] = "Scott";
    moreteam[2] = "John";
    console.log(newteam);
    console.log(moreteam);
    console.log(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const man = person;
    man.age = 30;
    console.log(man);
    console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    
    const human = Object.assign({}, person);
    human.age = 20;
    console.log(human);
    console.log(person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const hooman = {...person};
    hooman.age = 25;
    console.log(hooman);
    console.log(person);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
